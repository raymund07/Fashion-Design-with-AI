## Overview
`Clothes Cutout System` is a clothes cutout framework based on [dense CRF](http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/densecrf/). Given a fashion image and its [fashion landmarks](https://liuziwei7.github.io/projects/FashionLandmarks.html), this software segments the potential clothing item in it. 

## Requirements
* [dense CRF](http://www.philkr.net/papers/2011-12-01-nips/densecrf_v_2_2.zip)

## Getting started
* Install and compile the [dense CRF](http://www.philkr.net/papers/2011-12-01-nips/densecrf_v_2_2.zip).
* Run the demo script:
``` bash
matlab ./code/demo.m
```

## Dataset
[Large-scale Fashion (DeepFashion) Database](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html)
